            <h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a picture of me and Jared Polis! I worked as a canvasser when he was campaigning
                a while back and when he came into the office, he was more than happy to take a picture
                with me. His election campaign was immensely important to me, not only as a queer man myself,
                but also as a first-generation American and first-generation college student!
                <br>
                <br>
                I think this picture also just speaks to my dedication to being involed in issues that I care
                about. Admittedly, my focus on societal issues shifts every few years but I still try my best
                to make a change. Right now, an issue I'm particularly invested in is queer and women's health 
                especially since I plan to be an advocate for these issues when I'm a doctor in the future! 
                In fact, this summer, I have an internship with the NYAGI project which will involve me creating software
                to teach midwives and other pre-natal care specialists in remote regions of the world 
                how to use portable ultrasound to detect birth complications that will result in childbirth death.
                More than 300,000 women a year die from treatable birth complications so it's going to be awesome 
                making software that saves lives!

            <h2>I Also Rollerskate!</h2>
            <p>
                One of my most notable hobbies is rollerskating! I don't own a car so I rely on my skates to get me from point A
                to point B everyday (weather permitting, of course). When I'm not skating to the grocery store or school you'll find
                me skating on the Boulder Creek Trail or Skate City busting out my moves üï∫üèΩ. This isn't my exact pair of skates 
                (mine are much cooler) but I thought it'd be better to present a more polished image of them.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm going on about a year and a half for my skate journey and I still love it just as much as I did
                when I first started. I'm constantly improving and I've become excellent at skating backwards on all 
                terrains. Unfortunately, I don't get too much time to practice new skills during the school year but this 
                summer I definitely plan on learning how to skate on my toes and also try to pick up a few spinning tricks 
                at my local skate rink.
