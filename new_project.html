            <h2>Election Data and Benford's Law!</h2>
            <p>
                For CSCI 2275 (Data Structures), I created an algorithm to help determine whether or not an election was falsified
                by looking at the election statistics from various counties. I did this particularly to try and address a lot of the
                false claims about election fraud during the 2020 election. You can read about this project and download the code using
                this <a href="https://github.com/DevonQui/Quispe_CSCI2275_FinalProjec">link</a> I achieved this using Benford's Law.
                Benford’s Law is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. 
                Curiously, the frequency distribution creates a “universal” curve that many real-life data sets follow and I aimed to create 
                similar distributions to compare how well the election data matches up with Benford’s Law. Such comparisons are used to serve 
                as a way to flag data for fraud or tampering in data.

            <h2>My Poster Mailer Project from Text!</h2>
            <p>
                This is a project that I did for ATLS 2300 (Text) last fall! The goal of this project was to create an expressive
                event poster for the Colorado Symphony and it was super fun. I chose to style my poster around Gustav Holst's
                <em>The Planets</em> which is why this composition has a lot of space-y elements in it. It also features one of my
                favorite color combinations, pink and blue.

                I'm going on about a year and a half for my skate journey and I still love it just as much as I did
                when I first started. I'm constantly improving and I've become excellent at skating backwards on all 
                terrains. Unfortunately, I don't get too much time to practice new skills during the school year but this 
                summer I definitely plan on learning how to skate on my toes and also try to pick up a few spinning tricks 
                at my local skate rink.
