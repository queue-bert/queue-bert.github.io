                The numbers for the buttons already created below correspond to known notes and their frequencies.
                A quick Google search should tell you what frequency goes with the particular note that you'd like to add.
                Otherwise, feel free to add any number that you want! Try to play around with the buttons below to get a feel
                for what a good frequency would be to experiment with. Too high or too low of a frequency might make the sound
                unaudible if you don't happen to have great speakers on your device! Just a bit of warning before you explore.
