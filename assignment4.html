        <h2>Challenge 5: Accessibility Concerns</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like Challenge 4 would probably bring up the most issues in terms of accessibility. Depending on how bad or well someone set up a webpage like the one
            found on Google, screen reader accessibility could either be clear and intelligible or out of order nonsense. One possible bad way to set up the page would be
            to either block all page content into the same section or use an HTML table to layout our page. In the first case, the screen reader would most likely read 
            out the entire content without allowing the user to parse through the different sections one at time. In the second case, the screen reader would probably read things
            out of order if there wasn't a set way to read out the content laid out in the HTML table. A best practice to avoid this is to use semantic HTML and use the correct HTML elements
            for the different portions of our webpages. This means using the HTML button element for a button and not a label.
