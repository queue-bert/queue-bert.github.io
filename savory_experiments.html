            <h2>Savory Experiments Scholarship Essay üç±üç•üçî</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 10%;">
                Managing to slip away from my abuelita‚Äôs sight, I charged. With my arms positioned to evade capture and my
                 tiny legs struggling to keep pace with the might of my curiosity, I was just another seemingly crazed child
                  in an international market on a Friday evening. Weaving in and between the aisles, I was taken by the stacks
                   of colorful packaging and puzzled by the unfamiliar alphabets splashed across them. I ventured to poke, smell, 
                   contemplate, and taste everything the store could offer. That is, of course, until I‚Äôd be whisked away into the 
                   shopping cart and scolded.

                    Inspired by the international cooking shows my abuelita and I watched on public television, our Friday trips to the 
                international supermarkets in town meant we were cooking something special that night. Together we found delight in 
                turning raw ingredients into dishes we‚Äôd never tried before but my favorite part was actually picking them out. Through 
                feeling, smelling, and tasting each and every ingredient, I retreated into my mind where I could calculate portions, store
                 the profiles of various new ingredients, alter known recipes, and predict the taste outcomes of the recipes I had envisioned 
                 and hoped to bring into reality. I considered food combinations both practical and downright bizarre: unimagined uses for
                  uncooked ramen-noodles, a cheesecake with the same great taste and chewy surprise as boba, or perhaps a sushi roll with
                   fried yucca for an added crunch.

                <p style="text-indent: 10%;">
                It was through these formative experiences of exploring new flavors and creating new dishes with my abuelita that 
                I became an insatiable learner and inventor. Just as I engaged my senses to analyze new ingredients like the lotus 
                root or chu√±o for new dishes, I probed the natural world around me and formed hypotheses in the simple pursuit of 
                making new discoveries. When my middle school loaned me a computer to learn at home, I used online textbooks and Khan
                    Academy to devour whole curriculums of upper level content in my leisure time. Eventually, I acquired a taste for 
                    engineering, and began teaching myself computer programming. After all, the modern world as I saw it was constructed 
                    of bytes, and I had visions of changing it. I started small, honing my skills with simple Minecraft mods and Python scripts
                    to automate tasks. But by high school, I expanded. I founded a club teaching my peers programming to make apps to help their
                    communities and as a senior I created Bem Chavito, an app to help migrants find housing and nutrition resources in their
                    communities. An issue that‚Äôs personally significant to me as a first generation American and the son of a single immigrant mother.
                        Now in college, I lead a team building education software to provide the necessary knowledge for preventing deadly
                        birth complications in pregnant women around the world.

                            To me, knowledge provides the ingredients to create and connect with people on a much larger scale.
                          It forces us to challenge our worldview and use our knowledge as a building block to invent and have a real impact 
                          on those around us. As a college student,  I‚Äôve carried these beliefs far into my life and continue to use programming 
                          as an ingredient to help others. Being someone who wasn‚Äôt born into the best circumstances, it‚Äôs always been through a 
                          combination of my grit but also the kindness and charity of others that has helped me achieve my dreams and I wish to do
                          the same for others. I want them to see the world as I do,  their own personal supermarket of knowledge and experience to
                           give kindness forward and create a better future for themselves and others.
