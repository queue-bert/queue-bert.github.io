                For CSCI 2275 (Data Structures), I created an algorithm to help determine whether or not an election was falsified
                by looking at the election statistics from various counties. I did this particularly to try and address a lot of the
                false claims about election fraud during the 2020 election. You can read about this project and download the code using
                this <a href="https://github.com/DevonQui/Quispe_CSCI2275_FinalProjec">link</a>.

                This is a project that I did for ATLS 2300 (Text) last fall! The goal of this project was to create an expressive
                event poster for the Colorado Symphony and it was super fun. I chose to style my poster around Gustav Holst's
                <em>The Planets</em> which is why this composition has a lot of space-y elements in it. It also features one of my
                favorite color combinations, pink and blue.
