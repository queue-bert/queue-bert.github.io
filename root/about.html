                One of my most notable hobbies is rollerskating! I don't own a car so I rely on my skates to get me from point A
                to point B everyday (weather permitting, of course). When I'm not skating to the grocery store or school you'll find
                me skating on the Boulder Creek Trail or Skate City busting out my moves üï∫üèΩ. This isn't my exact pair of skates 
                (mine are much cooler) but I thought it'd be better to present a more polished image of them.

            <p>
                Another fact about me is that I love animals! In this picture, I'm holding my friend's guinea pig, Guy, rest his soul ü™¶.
                I also have two cats named Ollie and Phoebe although they don't currently live with me in Boulder, I visit them
                occasionally on the weekends. My love of animals also extends to my personal life choices as well. As a matter of fact,
                I'm going on seven years of being vegan (it's not that hard, I swear)!
